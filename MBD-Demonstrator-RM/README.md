# MBE Demonstrator RM 
Welcome to the Collaboration Repository for the Model Based Enterprise (MBE) Demonstrator Reference Model (RM) activity supporting Aerospace need across the industry standards activity. These models (Native CAD, STEP Models, and other data) are in support of goals for LOTAR and ISO. They also should be considered for other groups: [AFNeT](http://www.afnet.fr/), [PDES, Inc.](http://www.pdesinc.org/), and [prostep ivip](http://www.prostep.org/en/).

We will develop a plan for 2022/2023 enhancements of the MBE Demonstrator RM that will comprise version 1.2.  
The purpose of this product is to demonstrate standards based digital twin and digital thread.
